# Lab 02: I2C LCD (PCF8574 + HD44780, "LiquidCrystal-I2C" style)

## 1. Overview

Board: **ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1** (`esp32s3_devkitc/esp32s3/procpu`), framework: **Zephyr RTOS**.

This lab drives a common 16x2 HD44780-compatible character LCD sitting behind a **PCF8574(A) I2C GPIO expander** backpack (the "LCM1602 IIC" module). It reimplements what the Arduino `LiquidCrystal_I2C` library does, but as raw I2C on Zephyr (no Zephyr Display/CFB subsystem involved).

- The PCF8574 takes the 8-bit value it receives over I2C and drives it straight out onto 8 GPIO pins (P0-P7).
- Those 8 pins are wired to the HD44780's RS/RW/EN, a backlight transistor, and the 4-bit data bus (D4-D7).

In other words, this isn't "I2C to the LCD" - it's **"I2C to a GPIO expander, which then bit-bangs the parallel LCD protocol behind it."**

## 2. Address: 0x27 vs 0x3F

Depending on which expander chip is populated on the backpack, the I2C address differs.

| Populated chip | Default I2C address |
| --- | --- |
| PCF8574 | 0x27 |
| PCF8574A | 0x3F |

The module used for this lab is **0x3F (PCF8574A)**. The firmware scans the I2C bus at boot and uses 0x3F if found, falling back to 0x27 (and defaulting to 0x3F with a warning if neither is found).

## 3. PCF8574 bit map (standard LiquidCrystal_I2C wiring)

This is the de-facto wiring shared by essentially every "LCM1602 IIC" backpack and its Arduino library forks.

| PCF8574 pin | Connected to | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | LCD RS | 0 = command, 1 = data |
| P1 | LCD RW | Always driven 0 in this lab (write-only, busy flag never read) |
| P2 | LCD EN | Must be pulsed to latch the nibble |
| P3 | Backlight transistor gate | 1 = backlight on |
| P4-P7 | LCD D4-D7 | 4-bit data bus, upper nibble sent first |

If your particular module wires this differently (some low-cost clones are reported to), the symptom shows up as garbled characters or wrong cursor position - not as an I2C communication failure (the ACK/scan can still look fine). See the troubleshooting table in section 8.

## 4. Wiring

| Signal | ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1 | Backpack |
| --- | --- | --- |
| VCC | see section 5 | VCC |
| GND | GND | GND |
| SDA | GPIO1 (I2C0 SDA, board-default pinctrl) | SDA |
| SCL | GPIO2 (I2C0 SCL, board-default pinctrl) | SCL |

The board's default I2C0 pinctrl is used as-is, so the overlay only needs `&i2c0 { status = "okay"; ... };`.

## 5. Power / signal-level caution (important)

This backpack + LCD combination is usually **designed around 5V**:

- The PCF8574's own SDA/SCL pull-up resistors are typically already on the module, tied to VCC. Supplying 5V to VCC means the I2C bus idles high at 5V.
- The ESP32-S3's GPIOs are **3.3V-only** and are not rated for 5V input. Connecting a 5V bus directly to ESP32-S3 GPIOs risks long-term GPIO damage.
- The LCD's own contrast circuit is also usually tuned around 5V, so running it at 3.3V can leave characters looking very faint even after adjusting the contrast trimmer.

**Recommended order**:

1. Try running the module at 3.3V first (VCC -> the board's 3V3 pin) and adjust the contrast trimmer to see if characters become visible. Many HD44780 panels do work at 3.3V.
2. If nothing shows up at 3.3V (or only the backlight lights up with no characters), the panel likely needs 5V. In that case:
   - Supply VCC from the board's 5V pin.
   - Route SDA/SCL through a **bidirectional logic-level shifter** before connecting to the ESP32-S3 GPIOs.
3. Wiring a 5V bus directly to 3.3V GPIOs "just to see if it works" is common in hobbyist projects and often survives in practice, but it is out-of-spec use - go in with that understood.

The lab's code/overlay behave identically regardless of which power option is chosen (power wiring isn't something software can see).

## 6. HD44780 initialization sequence

Since RW is tied low and the busy flag is never read, initialization and each subsequent command simply wait out the datasheet's required delay instead (Hitachi HD44780U datasheet, Figure 24, "4-Bit Interface" procedure):

1. Wait >= 40 ms after power-up (the code uses a safe 50 ms)
2. Send nibble `0x3`, wait 5 ms
3. Send nibble `0x3`, wait 150 us
4. Send nibble `0x3`, wait 150 us
5. Send nibble `0x2` (switch to 4-bit mode), wait 150 us
6. From here on, normal 2-nibble (high, then low) byte commands:
   - Function Set `0x28` (4-bit bus, 2 lines, 5x8 font)
   - Display Off `0x08` (display off while configuring)
   - Clear Display `0x01` (wait 2 ms - a slow HD44780 command)
   - Entry Mode Set `0x06` (increment cursor, no display shift)
   - Display Control `0x0C` (display on, cursor/blink off)

## 7. Build & Run

```bash
west build -b esp32s3_devkitc/esp32s3/procpu lab
west flash
west espressif monitor
```

### Expected serial output

```
I2C LCD (PCF8574 + HD44780) lab starting
Scanning I2C0 bus (0x08-0x77)...
  found device at 0x3f
Using LCD backpack address 0x3f
LCD initialized and "Hello World!" / "ESP32-S3 Zephyr" written
```

The LCD itself should show `Hello World!` on the first line and `ESP32-S3 Zephyr` on the second.

## 8. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Check / fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Neither 0x27 nor 0x3F shows up in the scan | Wiring (including SDA/SCL swapped), or no power | Re-check wiring; review the full scan output in the `west espressif monitor` log |
| Scan succeeds but nothing shows on screen | If the backlight is on but no characters appear, this is usually a contrast issue | Adjust the backpack's trimmer potentiometer (not a driver bug) |
| Backlight doesn't light up either | Power (VCC/GND) issue, or a 5V-only module being run at 3.3V | See the power guide in section 5 |
| Characters stay faint / only readable from an angle even at max trimmer setting | Running at VDD=3.3V - HD44780 panels typically need V0 about 4-5V below VDD for good contrast, which 3.3V can't provide regardless of trimmer setting | Move to 5V VDD with a level shifter for SDA/SCL, per section 5 |
| Characters are garbled or show up in the wrong position | The bit map in section 3 doesn't match this particular module, or EN pulse timing is off | Re-check the bit map if using a different manufacturer's module |
| Only the first character is garbled, rest are fine | Initialization timing too tight | Increase the delays in `lcd_init()` and retry |
| The I2C write itself fails (ret != 0) | Wiring/power, or two I2C slaves sharing the same address | Check the `i2c_write` return value and the scan log |
